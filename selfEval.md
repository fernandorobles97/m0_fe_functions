# Self-Evaluation

- Reflect on your learning and work today. What are you most proud of?
I'm proud that I was able to utilize online resources more naturally, and that I've become more aware of which sources are easier for me to comprehend and navigate through. I think the For Statements assignment was the only one that had me desperately searching for answers online, and ultimately that made it easier for me to do. Also proud of how my technical vocabulary is beginning to improve!
- In your own words, why are functions a powerful tool in our applications?
  They can be especially beneficial when you need to do a certain task in your application, and there isn't a built-in method. Essentially a function could cut out multiple lines of code that were there to achieve one task and handle it instead with just a single call of the function. This makes it powerful and makes scrolling through code quicker and also easier to spot bugs.
